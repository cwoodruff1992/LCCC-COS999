LCCC-COS999
===========

J. Loftus  put this Readme out on 6/6/2012.  

    This is a repository for source code that we are working on for our workshop on using data structures and 
algorithms in game development.  The guys on the team encouraged me to go in this direction, and (since 
I'm an old codger), I was hesitant at first, but now I begin to see it's a very useful format for managing 
source code in a group environment.  

    As Josh pointed out in our last meeting, even getting some applied experience with a revision control system 
in a 'real world' environment would be quite useful for any LCCC CS major.  

    Probably the first upload will be the use interface shell that Dan is working on, either before or after I add some
of my routines.

This is a brief directory of the demostration files that I'm trying to 'sync' between my local repo and the github master repo.  

I'm hoping students who are participating in the COS999 workshop will take these, play around with them, and learn something
about applying data structures in the 'real world' setting.  

Test1 - recursive drawing of a maze, with order in which 'free' squares are produced displayed.

Disjoint Union - Uses Kruskal's algorithm for generating a spanning tree via Disjoint Union/Find data structure to 
construct random mazes by knocking down walls.  

Some motion 642012 - Uses Kruskals/Union to build maze, then has a game
element move around randomly, demonstrating the redraw of walls. 

Bread crumbs - demonstrates the use of a Dequeue data structure (FIFO queue)
to produce a trace behind the moving game element, and then erase the trace
along the path the element took in the order in which it was placed.  

Colorful bread crumbs - like Bread crumbs, just more colorful. :)

Recursive bread crumbs - using a stack to allow the dynamic game element to recursively find 
the exit for a randomly produced maze.
